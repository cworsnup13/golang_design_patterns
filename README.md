# golang_design_patterns

I recently came across the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oritented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

After reading through the chapters on Amazon I realized how great a resource this would be to strengthen my design mentality. 

This repo will serve as my experimentations to implement the concepts in Golang (as well as other design patterns more specific to Go).
